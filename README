Juste some tools for 0x10cc cpu coded in python3.

A debugger in pyqt, an assembler and a disassembler.

STATUS :

Assembler and debugger work fine on notch example(and
should works on everything but it has not been
very tested and some things still need to be implemented
in the debugger)

Disassembler should be rapidly implemented.
